This app, called speak-easy, is a free to use social platform 
that allows for people to create groups of likeminded people called
clubs, which required a password in order to enter.

these groups will have moderators that will look after each group and
enforce the rules set by each group moderator. People can ask the moderator
of a certain group to join that group, and if accepted, they will be provided
with entry.
